# Portfolio

This is a portfolio repository that I am using to host my game development projects.

JobHunt:

In order for this game to run correctly the following prerequisites must be installed first (normal DirectX requirements for most games):

- DirectX 11 runtime library:

- Visual Studio C++ Redistributable - vcredist_x86.exe from:

http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30679

Once these are installed the game can be started using JobHunt.exe Application file in the extracted Release directory.   The .zip includes the project and source files as well.  

I recommend maximizing the window when the game starts for proper mouse accuracy.
